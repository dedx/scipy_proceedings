Project-based introduction to scientific computing for physics majors
---------------------------------------------------------------------

.. class:: abstract

   Computational tools and skills are as critical to the training of physics majors as calculus and math, yet they receive much less emphasis in the undergraduate curriculum. One-off courses that introduce programming and basic numerical problem-solving techniques with commercial software packages for topics that appear in the traditional physics curriculum are insufficient to prepare students for the computing demands of modern technical careers. Yet tight budgets and rigid degree requirements constrain the ability to expand computational course offerings for physics majors.

   This talk will present an overview of a recently revamped course at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo that uses Python and associated scientific computing libraries to introduce the fundamentals of open-source tools, version control systems, programming, numerical problem solving and algorithmic thinking to undergraduate physics majors. The spirit of the course is similar to the bootcamps organized by Software Carpentry for researchers in science but is offered as a ten-week for-credit course. In addition to having a traditional in-class component, students learn the basics of Python by completing tutorials on Codecademy's Python track and practice their algorithmic thinking by tackling Project Euler problems. This approach of incorporating online training may provide a different way of thinking about the role of MOOCs in higher education. The early part of the course focuses on skill-building, while the second half is devoted to application of these skills to an independent research-level computational physics project. Examples of recent projects and their results will be presented.

Introduction
------------

Twelve hundred years ago  |---| in a galaxy just across the hill...

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vestibulum sapien
tortor, bibendum et pretium molestie, dapibus ac ante. Nam odio orci, interdum
sit amet placerat non, molestie sed dui. Pellentesque eu quam ac mauris
tristique sodales. Fusce sodales laoreet nulla, id pellentesque risus convallis
eget. Nam id ante gravida justo eleifend semper vel ut nisi. Phasellus
adipiscing risus quis dui facilisis fermentum. Duis quis sodales neque. Aliquam

quis nisi neque. Morbi ac odio et leo dignissim sodales. Pellentesque nec nibh
nulla. Donec faucibus purus leo. Nullam vel lorem eget enim blandit ultrices.
Ut urna lacus, scelerisque nec pellentesque quis, laoreet eu magna. Quisque ac
justo vitae odio tincidunt tempus at vitae tortor.

Of course, no paper would be complete without some source code.  Without
highlighting, it would look like this::

   def sum(a, b):
       """Sum two numbers."""

       return a + b

With code-highlighting:

.. code-block:: python

   def sum(a, b):
       """Sum two numbers."""

       return a + b

Maybe also in another language, and with line numbers:

.. code-block:: c
   :linenos:

   int main() {
       for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
           /* do something */
       }
       return 0;
   }

Or a snippet from the above code, starting at the correct line number:

.. code-block:: c
   :linenos:
   :linenostart: 2

   for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
       /* do something */
   }
 
Important Part
--------------

It is well known [Atr03]_ that Spice grows on the planet Dune.  Test
some maths, for example :math:`e^{\pi i} + 3 \delta`.  Or maybe an
equation on a separate line:

.. math::

   g(x) = \int_0^\infty f(x) dx

or on multiple, aligned lines:

.. math::
   :type: eqnarray

   g(x) &=& \int_0^\infty f(x) dx \\
        &=& \ldots


The area of a circle and volume of a sphere are given as

.. math::
   :label: circarea

   A(r) = \pi r^2.

.. math::
   :label: spherevol

   V(r) = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3

We can then refer back to Equation (:ref:`circarea`) or
(:ref:`spherevol`) later.

Mauris purus enim, volutpat non dapibus et, gravida sit amet sapien. In at
consectetur lacus. Praesent orci nulla, blandit eu egestas nec, facilisis vel
lacus. Fusce non ante vitae justo faucibus facilisis. Nam venenatis lacinia
turpis. Donec eu ultrices mauris. Ut pulvinar viverra rhoncus. Vivamus
adipiscing faucibus ligula, in porta orci vehicula in. Suspendisse quis augue
arcu, sit amet accumsan diam. Vestibulum lacinia luctus dui. Aliquam odio arcu,
faucibus non laoreet ac, condimentum eu quam. Quisque et nunc non diam
consequat iaculis ut quis leo. Integer suscipit accumsan ligula. Sed nec eros a
orci aliquam dictum sed ac felis. Suspendisse sit amet dui ut ligula iaculis
sollicitudin vel id velit. Pellentesque hendrerit sapien ac ante facilisis
lacinia. Nunc sit amet sem sem. In tellus metus, elementum vitae tincidunt ac,
volutpat sit amet mauris. Maecenas diam turpis, placerat at adipiscing ac,
pulvinar id metus.

.. figure:: figure1.png

   This is the caption. :label:`egfig`

.. figure:: figure1.png
   :align: center
   :figclass: w

   This is a wide figure, specified by adding "w" to the figclass.  It is also
   center aligned, by setting the align keyword (can be left, right or center).

.. figure:: figure1.png
   :scale: 20%
   :figclass: bht

   This is the caption on a smaller figure that will be placed by default at the
   bottom of the page, and failing that it will be placed inline or at the top.
   Note that for now, scale is relative to a completely arbitrary original
   reference size which might be the original size of your image - you probably
   have to play with it. :label:`egfig2`

As you can see in Figures :ref:`egfig` and :ref:`egfig2`, this is how you reference auto-numbered
figures.

.. table:: This is the caption for the materials table. :label:`mtable`

   +------------+----------------+
   | Material   | Units          |
   +------------+----------------+
   | Stone      | 3              |
   +------------+----------------+
   | Water      | 12             |
   +------------+----------------+
   | Cement     | :math:`\alpha` |
   +------------+----------------+


We show the different quantities of materials required in Table
:ref:`mtable`.


.. The statement below shows how to adjust the width of a table.

.. raw:: latex

   \setlength{\tablewidth}{0.8\linewidth}


.. table:: This is the caption for the wide table.
   :class: w

   +--------+----+------+------+------+------+--------+
   | This   | is |  a   | very | very | wide | table  |
   +--------+----+------+------+------+------+--------+


Perhaps we want to end off with a quote by Lao Tse:

  *Muddy water, let stand, becomes clear.*
